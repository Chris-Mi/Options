# Options
This repo contains Python codes for studying option pricing developed while (self) studying both options and learning simple programming.

As a pseudo Economist studying finance and interest in math and programming but mainly self-taught in the former fields, there is no pretentiousness of the most efficient and elegant coding here but only the desire of sharing (and maybe collecting feedbacks or spotting mistakes) some hopefully useful material to gain intuition in financial options relating stuff. The idea is to build a bridge between sexy but unpractical options math textobooks and rather sloppy practitioners books.
